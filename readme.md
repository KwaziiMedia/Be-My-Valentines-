# 💝Be My Valentine Project💝

This project is a heartfelt endeavor to ask my girlfriend to be my Valentine. It's more than just code - it's a symbol of affection and thoughtfulness. I hope this serves as an inspiration for others to create meaningful gifts for their loved ones.

## Technologies Used💻

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - a powerful trio that brings the concept to life.

## Project Goals 

The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive image that poses the question, "Will you be my Valentine?" If the user attempts to click "No", the image expresses sadness, and the "No" option playfully evades the cursor. This continues until the user finally clicks "Yes", accepting the Valentine's request.

Join me on this journey of love and coding, and may it inspire you to do the same!
